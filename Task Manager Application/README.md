Task Manager Application: 
  The application has 5 functions: 
  - Adding new tasks (one task has an id, a description, a due date, a priority level, and a completed status)
  - Editing already created tasks
  - Marking tasks as completed
  - Viewing uncompleted tasks
  - Viewing tasks that are due today (their due date is in 0 days)
  * Completed tasks are still saved in the arrayList with tasks, but are not shown, as once completed they should not exist in your to-do list

To use the application you must paste the code into a compiler and run it
 * If you are using a single file for all the classes, you should remove the "public" keyword before each class
